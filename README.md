Challenge Level -1
Write a react app which lists baby names from the given file.

It should display boys' and girls' names differently - your choice*

The names should be displayed in alphabetical order, ascending.

Your project should be on GitHub and Netlify with correct names (see Hosting, above).

(*) Please, please feel free to break from the the "blue-for-boys/pink-for-girls" stereotyping and style it differently. The best creative solution will be included in this challenge document for subsequent cohorts to admire.
